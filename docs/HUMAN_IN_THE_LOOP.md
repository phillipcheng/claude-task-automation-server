# Human-in-the-Loop Guide

This guide shows you how to monitor and control Claude's task execution in real-time, providing your own input when needed.

## Overview

The Human-in-the-Loop feature allows you to:
- **Monitor**: View the full conversation between Claude and the system
- **Inspect**: See exactly what Claude is doing and what responses it's receiving
- **Intervene**: Pause tasks and provide your own instructions
- **Override**: Replace auto-generated responses with your expert judgment
- **Resume**: Continue task execution with your custom input

This transforms fully autonomous execution into **supervised autonomous** mode.

## Prerequisites

1. Server is running: `python -m app.main`
2. Web UI is accessible at: `http://localhost:8000/`
3. Database migration applied:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN custom_human_input TEXT NULL;
   ```

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Create a Test Task

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/`
2. Fill in the create task form:
   - **Task Name**: `test-human-loop`
   - **Description**: `Create a simple greeting function that says hello to a user by name`
   - **Project Root Folder**: `/tmp/test-project` (or your test directory)
   - **Branch Name**: (leave empty)
   - ‚úÖ Check "Use Git Worktree"
   - ‚úÖ Check "Auto-start task immediately"
3. Click "Create Task"

The task will start running immediately.

### Step 2: View the Conversation

1. Find your task in the "Active Tasks" list
2. Click the **"üí¨ View Conversation"** button
3. A modal window opens showing the conversation

**What you'll see:**
- ü§ñ **Blue messages**: Claude's responses
- üé≠ **Yellow messages**: Simulated human responses (auto-generated)
- Each message has a timestamp
- Messages are displayed in chronological order

### Step 3: Monitor Claude's Work

Watch the conversation in real-time:

1. Click the **"üîÑ Refresh"** button to see new messages
2. Scroll through to see what Claude has done:
   - Initial task request
   - Claude's analysis and implementation
   - Auto-generated confirmations
   - Claude's follow-up questions

**Example conversation you might see:**
```
üë§ Human: Create a simple greeting function...
ü§ñ Claude: I'll create a greeting function. Let me implement this...
üé≠ Simulated: Yes, that looks good. Please continue.
ü§ñ Claude: I've created greeting.py with a hello() function...
```

### Step 4: Stop the Task

When you want to intervene:

1. Close the conversation modal (click outside or "Close" button)
2. Find the task in the list
3. Click the **"Stop"** button
4. Task status changes to "STOPPED"

### Step 5: Review and Decide to Intervene

1. Click **"üí¨ View Conversation"** again
2. Read through Claude's latest responses
3. Decide if you want to provide custom guidance

**Example scenario:**
- Claude asks: "Should I add input validation?"
- Auto-response said: "Yes, proceed"
- You want to say: "Add validation but also include error logging"

### Step 6: Edit Custom Input

1. In the conversation modal, click **"‚úçÔ∏è Edit Input"**
2. A text editor appears at the bottom
3. Type your custom message:

**Example custom inputs:**

```
Good progress! For the greeting function, please also:
1. Add type hints
2. Include a docstring with examples
3. Handle empty string inputs gracefully
4. Add a test case in tests/test_greeting.py
```

Or:

```
I reviewed your implementation. Instead of using a simple string,
please return a dictionary with:
{
  "message": "Hello, {name}!",
  "timestamp": <current_time>,
  "user": name
}
```

### Step 7: Send Custom Input

1. After typing your message, click **"Send Input"**
2. You'll see an alert: "Custom input set! The task will use this when resumed."
3. The input editor closes automatically
4. Your message is saved (but not sent to Claude yet)

### Step 8: Resume the Task

1. Close the conversation modal
2. Click the **"Resume"** button on the task
3. Task status changes to "RUNNING"
4. Claude receives YOUR message instead of auto-generated response

### Step 9: Verify Your Input Was Used

1. Wait a few seconds for Claude to process
2. Click **"üí¨ View Conversation"** again
3. Click **"üîÑ Refresh"** to see the latest messages
4. You should see:
   - Your message marked as **üë§ Human** (purple background)
   - Claude's response to YOUR instructions
   - Task continuing based on your guidance

### Step 10: Continue Monitoring or Intervening

You can repeat this process as many times as needed:
- Let task run autonomously (auto-responses)
- Stop and inspect when you want
- Provide custom input for critical decisions
- Resume and continue

## Real-World Example Walkthrough

### Scenario: Implementing a User Login System

**Initial Task:**
```
Task: Implement user login with authentication
```

**Conversation Flow:**

```
[Auto-generated conversation]
üë§ Human: Implement user login with authentication
ü§ñ Claude: I'll create a login system. Should I use JWT tokens or sessions?
üé≠ Simulated: Yes, proceed with JWT tokens.
ü§ñ Claude: Implementing JWT-based authentication...
```

**You notice this and want to intervene:**

1. **Stop** the task
2. **View Conversation** - review what Claude is doing
3. **Edit Input** and type:
```
Actually, let's use session-based authentication with Redis for this project.
JWT is overkill for our use case. Please:
1. Use Flask-Session with Redis backend
2. Store sessions for 24 hours
3. Include CSRF protection
4. Add remember-me functionality
```
4. **Send Input**
5. **Resume** task
6. **Refresh Conversation** - see Claude switch to session-based approach

**Result:** Task continues with your architectural decision instead of the auto-generated choice.

## Use Cases

### 1. Quality Assurance
**When:** Task is running well, but you want to review progress

**Action:**
- View conversation periodically
- Verify Claude is on the right track
- Let it continue if everything looks good

### 2. Course Correction
**When:** Claude is going in the wrong direction

**Action:**
- Stop immediately
- Provide specific guidance
- Resume with your corrections

### 3. Complex Decisions
**When:** Auto-responder can't make the right call

**Action:**
- Stop when Claude asks important questions
- Provide expert judgment
- Resume with your decision

### 4. Adding Requirements
**When:** You realize something is missing

**Action:**
- Stop the task
- Add new requirements via custom input
- Resume to incorporate changes

### 5. Debugging
**When:** Task fails or behaves unexpectedly

**Action:**
- View full conversation
- Identify where things went wrong
- Provide corrective instructions

## API Usage (Command Line)

If you prefer command-line instead of web UI:

### View Conversation
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/conversation | jq
```

### Set Custom Input
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/set-input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your custom message to Claude here"
  }'
```

### Complete CLI Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_name": "my-task",
    "description": "Task description",
    "root_folder": "/path/to/project",
    "auto_start": true
  }'

# 2. Monitor conversation
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/conversation | jq ".conversation[-5:]"'

# 3. Stop task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/stop

# 4. Set custom input
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/set-input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Please add error handling to all database operations"
  }'

# 5. Resume
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/resume

# 6. Verify custom input was used
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/by-name/my-task/conversation | jq '.conversation[-3:]'
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. When to Intervene
‚úÖ **Do intervene when:**
- Claude asks important architectural questions
- You notice the approach is suboptimal
- Requirements change mid-task
- Auto-response makes wrong assumptions
- You want to add specific constraints

‚ùå **Don't intervene when:**
- Task is progressing well
- Claude is handling things correctly
- Auto-responses are appropriate
- Minor stylistic differences

### 2. Writing Effective Custom Input

**Good custom input:**
```
Great progress on the API! For the next steps:
1. Add input validation using Pydantic models
2. Include rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
3. Add API documentation with example requests
4. Create integration tests covering happy path and errors
```

**Less effective:**
```
Make it better
```

**Why?** Specific, actionable instructions help Claude understand exactly what you want.

### 3. Monitoring Frequency

- **High-stakes tasks**: Check every 2-3 interactions
- **Routine tasks**: Check once or twice total
- **Experimental tasks**: Monitor continuously

### 4. Combining with Stop/Resume

Strategy:
1. Let task run with auto-responses (autonomous mode)
2. Stop at checkpoints (e.g., after major milestones)
3. Review conversation
4. Provide input if needed
5. Resume

This balances automation with control.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see conversation
**Solution:**
- Ensure task has started (not pending)
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Custom input not being used
**Solution:**
- Verify you clicked "Send Input"
- Check alert confirmed "Custom input set"
- Ensure you clicked "Resume" after setting input
- Wait a few seconds, then refresh conversation

### Issue: Task stops after custom input
**Solution:**
- Check task status (might be completed)
- Review conversation for errors
- Verify your input was clear and actionable

### Issue: Messages not updating
**Solution:**
- Click "Refresh" button in modal
- Close and reopen conversation modal
- Check server is still running

## Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Normal Flow (Auto-Response):**
```
Claude responds ‚Üí System pauses ‚Üí Generates auto-response ‚Üí Sends to Claude
```

2. **Human-in-the-Loop Flow:**
```
Claude responds ‚Üí User stops task ‚Üí User views conversation
‚Üí User edits input ‚Üí User sends custom input ‚Üí User resumes task
‚Üí System uses custom input instead of auto-response ‚Üí Sends to Claude
```

### Data Flow

```
Web UI ‚Üí API Endpoint ‚Üí Database (custom_human_input column)
‚Üí Task Executor checks for custom input ‚Üí Uses custom if available
‚Üí Otherwise generates auto-response ‚Üí Sends to Claude
‚Üí Saves interaction to database ‚Üí Web UI refreshes conversation
```

### Message Types

- **`user_request`**: Initial task or user's custom input (purple)
- **`claude_response`**: Claude's responses (blue)
- **`simulated_human`**: Auto-generated responses (yellow)
